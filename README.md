# Multi-Band-Equaliser

//TODO: The file path for the background image is only routed to work on my local machine. I need to fix it so that it will be relative to the project folder.

//TODO: Update sliders to be non-linear as well as use DBFS{-48, +6} instead of float{0.02f, 2.0f} as the range of values for the output gain.

//TODO: Update sliders to animate and be more user friendly

This equaliser plugin consists of a low cut filter with frequency and slope control; 3 fully customizable parametric eq bands with frequency control, slope/q control, and gain control; and a high cut filter with frequency and slope control. There is also a slider for output gain.  

Everything works as expected and there are no known bugs.
